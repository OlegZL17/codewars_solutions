<div><a href="https://www.codewars.com/" title='Codewars'>Codewars</a> is an educational community for computer programming. 
On the platform, software developers train on programming challenges known as kata. 
These discrete programming exercises train a range of skills in a variety of programming languages, 
and are completed within an online integrated development environment. On Codewars the community 
and challenge progression is gamified, with users earning ranks and honor for completing kata, 
contributing kata, and quality solutions.</div>
